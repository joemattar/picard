      <p class="body_text">I was born to Maurice and Yvette Picard in La Barre, France, on 13 July 2305. As a child, I dreamed of joining Starfleet. I speak English, with the UK English dialect — the French language having become obscure by the 24th century.
        I have a special pride in being French. But I also have a number of British habits, including the regular consumption of Earl Grey tea, a fondness for Shakespeare (which I perform in holodeck simulations), riding horses with English tack and a
        knowledge of such British songs with Royal Navy associations as "A British Tar" (Gilbert and Sullivan) and "Heart of Oak".</p>

      <p class="body_text"> As a young man, I failed my first Starfleet Academy entrance exam, and, upon admission, met with numerous ethical/scholastic difficulties during my cadet career, but went on to flourish, developing a lifelong passion for archaeology, and became the first freshman
        to win the Academy marathon. Shortly after graduation, I was stabbed in the heart by a Nausicaan, leaving the organ irreparable and requiring replacement with a parthenogenetic implant; this would prove near-fatal later. My first posting as an Ensign was
        on the USS Reliant, later serving as first officer aboard the USS Stargazer, which I later commanded. During that time, I performed a warp-speed battle tactic that would become known as the Picard Maneuver.

      <p class="body_text">Deeply moral, highly logical, and intelligent, I am a master of diplomacy and debate who resolves seemingly intractable issues between multiple, sometimes implacable parties with a Solomon-like wisdom. Though such resolutions are usually
        peaceful, I also use my remarkable tactical cunning in situations when it is required. I have a fondness for detective stories, Shakespearean drama, and archeology. My catchphrases are "Make it so" and "Engage", but also "Tea, Earl grey, hot"
        when ordering from the computer's replicator.
